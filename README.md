# ProosaXY
CoreXY conversion for Prusa MK3/S. This build is aiming at getting more performance out of your 6 years old machine with the lowest cost possible by re-using most the MK3/S stock parts.

## 1. Features

- Better performance (check input-shaper graph bellow).
- Semi-enclosure by default. Panels mount and top hat parts will be added later.
- ~~Dual z axis(default) or independent tripple Z axis(Optional)~~ Triple Z (independent or sync based on controller board) by default or dual Z(optional).
- Single v6 hotend(default) or mixed 2-in-1-out hotend(WIP).
- Optional AUX cooling fan.
- Semi-enclosured(default) or Fully-enclosured with top hat(comming soon).
- Our industrial leading SnakeOil technology :).

## 2. Status

- All the main parts design are completed. Test print result are posted in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WZVP2HuAag)
- All part STLs are exported. 
- Full BOM added 2023/07/11
- I'm working on a simple build log/manual. 
- For updates, please visit our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WZVP2HuAag)



![](./doc/img/shaper.png)
- The input-shaper calibration is quite good for an 8mm shaft machine, in my opinion. We have a recommended acceleration of about 6000 mm/s2 (which should be used as the limit for outer perimeter acceleration), and a higher maximum acceleration/speed, depending on how fast your motor can run.
- For some extra speed boost, check my [slicer plugin](https://github.com/SnakeOilXY/klipper-dynamic-scv-slicer-post-processing) (klipper firmware only)

## 3. Warning - read this

- This mod requires some drilling on the original frame, cutting the original motor leadscrew, and linear shafts. This drilling/cutting is easy enough to be done with a hand drill and a hacksaw **BUT THERE IS NO WAY BACK. You won't be able to convert back to the original MK3/s machine if you change your mind later.**
- Some small changes/patches might be needed after I have more test data and feedback..
- To keep the cost down and reuse old components, there are some trade-offs I made:
    - The machine is semi-enclosed by default and will need some printed panels and a top hats to fully enclose it.
    - To match the frame height, cutting the motor leadscrew and linear shafts is required.
